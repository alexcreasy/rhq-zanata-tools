rhq-zanata-tools
================

rhq-zanata-push.sh - script takes no arguments, clones the RHQ repo from github, checkout the latest JON 3.3.x release branch and pushes the source .properties files to the jboss zanata server.
NOTE: The script does not quite run fully unattended, you will need to enter Y to a prompt to initiate the push to the zanata server.
